# How Do Users Like Their Tangibles? - A Dataset of Cross-Device Interaction Techniques Performed With Everday Objects as Tangibles

```
Even if numerous interaction techniques and tools exist for cross-device data transfer,
it is still a cumbersome process that is often limited in compatibility.
We address this issue by bringing together cross-device data transfer and tangible user interfaces (TUIs),
which have been shown to make human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive.
Through qualitative research, we create an overview of users’ needs in data transfer.

By holding a workshop as a first step, we found that users transfer data in diverse contexts
and appreciate the idea of everyday objects as tangibles. In a second step, we conducted an elicitation study
with 30 participants to examine intuitive interaction techniques for tangible data transfer in different situations.

Our results show that designing effective tangibles requires consideration of various factors,
which strongly depend on the target group and intended use case. In a personal setting,
users might prefer multifunctional devices over single-use ones.
In addition, it is important to investigate users’ associations with the object.
Since users tend to fall back on known interaction techniques and devices,
it is essential to assess the added value of new ones compared to existing systems.
Based on these findings, we provide design guidelines for tangible user interfaces in data transfer.

In this repository, we offer our dataset inclueding performed interactions with different everyday objects in three different situations from our task-based user study.
